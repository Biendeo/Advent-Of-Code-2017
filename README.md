# Advent-Of-Code-2017
This is my attempt at solving each puzzle in the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) challenge. I've attempted all of these solutions using various C++ techniques.

I've never used CMake formally before, so I've tried to use it here. Each project should be broken up into two executables. Each assignment is listed down below.

### Day 1: Inverse Captcha
Take in a string of digits (given as a commandline argument), and compute a sum based on the digits. The two parts of this are separated by preprocessor definitions.
